This project is to allow me to practice and build my CSS skills. There are so
many cool things in CSS that I want to learn like different animations and other
cool design techniques. Inspired by this awesome website: https://a.singlediv.com/
which showed me how much can be done with just CSS. 

My first project explores text animations as I attempted to recreate the iconic
Star Wars scroll opening.
